Overview

This project is a soil moisture–controlled automated plant watering system built using an Arduino microcontroller and a Java application. The system continuously monitors soil moisture through an analog sensor, converts raw readings into voltage values, and evaluates them using a threshold-based state machine to determine when and how long a water pump should be activated. 

The Java application operates as a time-driven, event-based system using scheduled tasks (TimerTask). Moisture data is visualized live using JFreeChart, allowing trends in soil conditions to be observed over time and making system behavior easy to validate.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical experience with embedded control systems, real-time scheduling, sensor integration, state-machine logic, data visualization, and testing, all applied to a physical, real-world system.
